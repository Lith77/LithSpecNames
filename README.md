# LithSpecNames
An addon that lets you name your specs making it easier to keep track if your specs are similar. Mark it as PVE, Raid, PVP or anything you like.
Maybe you have two Specs that have just some small changes, maybe a Disc priest PVE build and a Disc PVP build, do you now and then have to look deeper into the chosen tallents to be sure what spec is for what. Then look no further, just name your spec with **Lith**SpecNames
